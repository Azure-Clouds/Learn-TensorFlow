# Tutorials for TensorFlow
### Influenced from the [Tensorflow Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice) Course. 
#### Many Extra Issues, Concepts and Visualizations are added.    
* Start with building blocks of Deep Neural Networks and Slowly Build and Understand Convolutional Neural Network. 
Below is an example of how Conv and Max Pool layer understand features, training images are from MNIST Fashion Data-Set.
